# WakaTime Firefox Addon for GitHub

[![time tracker](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/deekayen/wakatime-github.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/deekayen/wakatime-github) [![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

Bundle up all the files except the `.git` folder, LICENSE, and README.md as a zip file, rename it to `.xpi`, then import it to your browser. You may have to switch to something like [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) so that it will let you edit `about:config` to disable `xpinstall.signatures.required`.

Or build and test with the `web-ext` utility.
